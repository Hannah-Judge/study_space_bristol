    <h1>Study Space: Bristol</h1>
    <p> Prefer the buzz of background noise when you work? Like to sip coffee as you type? So do we! That's why we've put together an online catalogue of the best Bristol-based cafes for students to work in. From well known highstreet chains to hidden away independents, all of the cafes you'll find here have been suggested and reviewed by current students living in Bristol. We use criteria that are important to students, like how many plug sockets a cafe has, Wifi speed and availability, price of coffee, and how long you can get away with working there before you feel like you're taking up space! Study Space: Bristol is a resource created by students, for students.</p>

    <p>Pinkman’s Bakery on Park Street is an ideal location if you need to be in the Wills Memorial Building/Berkeley Square area for work. On entering the café, you’re greeted by friendly staff behind  a long counter with large array of tempting pastries, cakes, salads and sandwiches. There are a few seats and a work bench at the front of the shop, but you have to be particularly keen (or lucky) to bag these. Head through to the back however, and there a long rows of tables that you can work at. It can get a little busy at times (which is only a testament to its amazing food!) so it can be hard to find a space during the lunch rush/early afternoon. On that note – I had the BEST cheese scone I have ever eaten here, toasted with butter and caramelised onion chutney – would definitely recommend!! The long tables mean you can normally squeeze in somewhere without feeling guilty for taking up a whole table, but if you work best in a more quiet environment I’d recommend  checking it out in the evening. When I studied there from 5pm-7pm, there was plenty of space. The warm lighting and low hanging plants give Pinkman’s a very cosy feel and it’s a welcome escape from Bristol’s wet weather.</p>

   <p>Friska, conveniently located on Park Street near the Wills Memorial Building, is perfect for a quick study sesh for when you are on the go.When I visited at peak lunchtime it was very adequately staffed (putting some other chain cafés to shame!) and the service was not onlyquick, but minimally chaotic. With such a wide variety of food, from Asian to Mediterranean cuisine, it would be difficult to not find something to your liking. All food is clearly labelled, offering many vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options and I was pleased that my hotchocolate was able to be made with soya milk (other milk alternatives are available, but also at an extra cost of £0.30)- the chefs are willing to try and cater to any special dietary requirements. Although initially the Wi-Fi only worked haphazardly, it did eventually run smoothly- making Friska a great choice for a casual study space. Be aware that the kitchen is semi-exposed so if you need a quieter ambience, maybe go early in the morning or sit at a more isolated table. Overall Friska is a stylish and welcoming café (its Bristol-themed mural created by local artist Harriet Popham adds to its fashionable décor) and its commitment to maintaining a low environmental impact is admirable.</p>

  <p>If you’ve spent the last few weeks cooped up in a gloomy library hunched over your laptop, the chances are you’ll be craving a bit of light and fresh air. East village cafe is the perfect spot. Located in the centre of Clifton Village and with a bright, fresh interior, this was my go to spot for a laid back study session. Big windows let in lots of sunlight and a view of bustling Clifton, there are plants everywhere you look, and the long countertop is overflowing with salads, sandwiches and sweet treats (all 100% vegetarian and vegan). Besides all of this, what makes East village cafe a great place to do some work is the fact that lots of the tables are two seaters so you don’t have to feel guilty about taking up one all to yourself for a few hours while you work. If you look around you’ll notice that lots of other people are doing the same so you’ll never feel rushed. The best time to go is in the afternoon around 3pm after the lunch rush, when there is lots of space and the noise level is perfect for some concentrated studying. In fact, they do ask you not to work on laptops during their busiest periods (lunch and at the weekends) - so plan around this! Order a warm drink and a slice of cake, grab a table by the window, and spend a few hours catching up on some work….trust me, you’ll be back again in no time!</p>

    <p>The Bristol Loaf is a café/bakery on Church Road. The café space is comprised of two relatively small rooms: the first houses the counter, and an impressive selection of sandwiches, cakes and pastries. The pastries in particular looked amazing (and huge!) and had me seriously regretting my decision to eat breakfast before I came. In this room, there are a couple of tables and a worktop that looks out onto Church Road – perfect for people watching (or procrastinating).  In the second room, there are slightly more tables, plus a worktop that runs along two sides of the room.   There is an inhouse bakery attached which means not only does the whole café smell incredible but you can also peek behind and see the bakers at work. White tiled walls, hanging shrubbery and large windows makes the café feel very light and airy.</p>
