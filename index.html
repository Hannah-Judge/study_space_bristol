    <h1>Study Space: Bristol</h1>
    <p> Prefer the buzz of background noise when you work? Like to sip coffee as you type? So do we! That's why we've put together an online catalogue of the best Bristol-based cafes for students to work in. From well known highstreet chains to hidden away independents, all of the cafes you'll find here have been suggested and reviewed by current students living in Bristol. We use criteria that are important to students, like how many plug sockets a cafe has, Wifi speed and availability, price of coffee, and how long you can get away with working there before you feel like you're taking up space! Study Space: Bristol is a resource created by students, for students.</p>

    <p>The Bristol Loaf is a café/bakery on Church Road. The café space is comprised of two relatively small rooms: the first houses the counter, and an impressive selection of sandwiches, cakes and pastries. The pastries in particular looked amazing (and huge!) and had me seriously regretting my decision to eat breakfast before I came. In this room, there are a couple of tables and a worktop that looks out onto Church Road – perfect for people watching (or procrastinating).  In the second room, there are slightly more tables, plus a worktop that runs along two sides of the room.   There is an inhouse bakery attached which means not only does the whole café smell incredible but you can also peek behind and see the bakers at work. White tiled walls, hanging shrubbery and large windows makes the café feel very light and airy.</p>
    <p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Americano: £2.30</li>
      <li>Latte: £2.60</li>

    <p><strong>Plugs:</strong> There are only four double socket plugs that run under the countertop in the second room. That said, I stayed from 11am-1pm and it was quiet enough that there was little competition for them.</p>
    <p><strong>Music:</strong> None</p>
    <p><strong>Notes -</strong> The Bristol Loaf is closed on Sundays and Mondays!</p>
