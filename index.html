    <h1>Study Space: Bristol</h1>
    <p> Prefer the buzz of background noise when you work? Like to sip coffee as you type? So do we! That's why we've put together an online catalogue of the best Bristol-based cafes for students to work in. From well known highstreet chains to hidden away independents, all of the cafes you'll find here have been suggested and reviewed by current students living in Bristol. We use criteria that are important to students, like how many plug sockets a cafe has, Wifi speed and availability, price of coffee, and how long you can get away with working there before you feel like you're taking up space! Study Space: Bristol is a resource created by students, for students.</p>

   <h2>Pinkman's Bakery</h2>
   <p>85 Park St, Bristol, BS1 5PJ</p>

   <p>Pinkman’s Bakery on Park Street is an ideal location if you need to be in the Wills Memorial Building/Berkeley Square area for work. On entering the café, you’re greeted by friendly staff behind  a long counter with large array of tempting pastries, cakes, salads and sandwiches. There are a few seats and a work bench at the front of the shop, but you have to be particularly keen (or lucky) to bag these. Head through to the back however, and there a long rows of tables that you can work at. It can get a little busy at times (which is only a testament to its amazing food!) so it can be hard to find a space during the lunch rush/early afternoon. On that note – I had the BEST cheese scone I have ever eaten here, toasted with butter and caramelised onion chutney – would definitely recommend!! The long tables mean you can normally squeeze in somewhere without feeling guilty for taking up a whole table, but if you work best in a more quiet environment I’d recommend  checking it out in the evening. When I studied there from 5pm-7pm, there was plenty of space. The warm lighting and low hanging plants give Pinkman’s a very cosy feel and it’s a welcome escape from Bristol’s wet weather.</p>

    <h2>The Bristol Loaf</h2>
    <p>213 Church Road, Redfield, Bristol BS5 9HF</p>

    <p>The Bristol Loaf is a café/bakery on Church Road. The café space is comprised of two relatively small rooms: the first houses the counter, and an impressive selection of sandwiches, cakes and pastries. The pastries in particular looked amazing (and huge!) and had me seriously regretting my decision to eat breakfast before I came. In this room, there are a couple of tables and a worktop that looks out onto Church Road – perfect for people watching (or procrastinating).  In the second room, there are slightly more tables, plus a worktop that runs along two sides of the room.   There is an inhouse bakery attached which means not only does the whole café smell incredible but you can also peek behind and see the bakers at work. White tiled walls, hanging shrubbery and large windows makes the café feel very light and airy.</p>
    <p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Americano: £2.30</li>
      <li>Latte: £2.60</li>
      <li>English Breakfast Tea: £2.30</li>
      <li> + almond and oat milk available at no extra cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Wifi:</strong> Available. Ask at the counter for the password.</p>
    <p><strong>Plugs:</strong> There are only four double socket plugs that run under the countertop in the second room. That said, I stayed from 11am-1pm and it was quiet enough that there was little competition for them.</p>
